# agent_mapping.py — AgentMapping Document controller
#
# This file is intentionally minimal. All outbound routing logic has been
# moved to dedicated modules alongside this doctype:
#
#   webrtc_dialer.py  —  Softphone (WebRTC) routing via agent extension ID
#   pstn_dialer.py    —  PSTN routing via a physical forwarding number
#
# The Agent Mapping form (agent_mapping.js) calls those modules directly
# via frappe.call() using their full Python module paths.

    Maps a Frappe User to their Smartflo telephony configuration.

    Fields:
        user                — linked Frappe User (unique, required)
        device_type         — "Softphone (WebRTC)" or "PSTN (Mobile/Landline)"
        smartflo_agent_id   — agent extension ID (Softphone path)
        call_forward_number — physical number to bridge (PSTN path)
        did_number          — outbound caller ID for this agent
        intercom            — internal extension for call transfer

    Routing logic is handled by:
